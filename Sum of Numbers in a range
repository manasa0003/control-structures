Input & Output Format:
Input consists of two integers.

First input consists of the start value.

Second input consists of the end value.

Output consists of the sum of range.

Sample Input :

1

10

Sample Output :

55


b=int(input())
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n+1):
    b+=1
    a=(n*(n+1))//2
print(a)
